# Wine Quality Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files and code for building and evaluating a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. The model utilizes data from both red and white wines, employing feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance and using a RandomForest classifier for the prediction.

## Datasets
The project uses two main datasets:
- `winequality-red.csv`: Data on red wines.  
- `winequality-white.csv`: Data on white wines.

These datasets include several variables related to the chemical properties of wines, which are used to predict wine quality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x)
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
   cd wine-quality-prediction
